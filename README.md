=======================

IRS Form 1040EZ is the simplest of the three tax forms you can use to file your federal income taxes. If your taxable income is less than $100,000, you donâ€™t claim any dependents and you file as single or are married filing jointly, then you may be eligible to file Form 1040EZ. The one-page form has four short sections that you need to complete. It allows you to prepare and file your federal return for free.
